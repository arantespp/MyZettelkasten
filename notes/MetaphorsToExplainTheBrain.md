## Notes

- We don't know properly how our brain works, so we use metaphors trying to understand it.
- In different times, we used to compare our brain with the most advanced thinking we had at that moment:
  - The earliest one was that God created us with clay and dirty and the intelligence was infused by His spirit.
  - In the 3rd century BCE, with the invention of hydraulic engineering, we believed that our body and mind worked with a flow of different fluids called 'humours'.
  - In the 1500s, the brain was compared as complex machines because of the systems composed by gears and springs.
  - In the 1600s, the philosopher Thomas Hobbes suggested that thinking was created with the motion of small mechanics in the brain.
  - In the 1700s, new theories were created because of the discoveries about electricity and chemistry.
  - In the 1800s, inspired by recent advances in communication, the German physicist Hermann von Helmholtz compared the brain to a telegraph.
  - In the 1940s, the current one, with the creation of the computers, the brain was said to operate as a computer - we save and process memories as computers does. This analogy is also called Information Processing (IP) metaphor.
