## Notes

- We believe in things because i) they're correct or ii) we belong to a group.
  - Even if the facts aren't true, we may believe in something because we want to be a part of a group.
  - Being part of a group is wired in our brain because of our evolutionary history. Not belonging to any tribe was a death sentence.
    - Nowadays, probably we won't die, but we have the fear to be socially rejected.
- It's hard to change someone's mind because we're telling to him/her leaves some group and this causes fear of being alone about the new fact.
  - A way to change someone mind is to create a connection first, show to him/her that he/she won't be alone, and will be a part of a tribe.
