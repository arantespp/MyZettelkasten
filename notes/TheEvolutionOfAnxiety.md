## Notes

- Currently, humans are living in what researchers call a **Delayed Return Environment**.
  - We worry about problems that won't be solved immediately by our actions - we work today to get a paycheck in a few week, for instance.
- The Delayed Return Environment causes chronic anxiety and stress because our brain was designed to live in an Immediate Return Environment.
  - Our brain has roughly the same size as our ancestors of two hundred thousand years ago.
  - On the other side, the society became mostly Delayed Return Environment about 500 years ago, which is a very small window of time to our brain to evolve.
- The Immediate Return Environment creates some stress and anxiety. It was necessary to help our ancestors (and some wild animals) to survive.
  - A lion appear -> you fell stressed -> you run away to survive -> the stress is relieved.
- Nowadays, we still expect the same process, except that the relived part doesn't occur immediately.
  - We imagine our future -> we need money to live well -> we study to get a good job -> but we **don't** get a job (and money) immediately. This causes chronic stress and anxiety because it isn't relieved.
- Living and Delayed Return Environment means you're surrounded by uncertainty. We can do two things to minimize it:
  1. **Measure something**. When we measure something, we transform the unknown quantity and make it known, and you became more certain of something.
      - For instance, if you're looking for a job, count how many companies you sent your resume.
  2. **Shift your worry**. Instead worring about a long-term problem, focus on a daily routine that will solve your problem.
      - Instead of worrying about living longer, focus on doing some exercises today.
