## Notes

- Chunking is a memorization method in which you group pieces of information in groups.
- This technique helps you memorize better because our [Short-Term Memory](ShortTermMemory.md) cannot retain a lot of information at the same time.
  - When we group, we can retain the groups instead of each piece of information.
- Also, chunking improves our creativity because we need to create a meaningful connection among groups.
