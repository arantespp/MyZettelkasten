## Notes

- Anthropologists have found evidences that sleeping in two shitfs/bimodal sleeping was a norm before [Pre-industrial Europe](./PreIndustrialEurope.md).
  - Historian A. Roger Ekirch's book [At Day's Close: Night in Times Past](https://www.amazon.com/At-Days-Close-Night-Times/dp/0393329011) describes that households at this time started to sleep at dusk, woke up a few hours latter for one or two hours and then went sleep again until the dawn.
  - During the waking period, people would relax or do some activities.
  - Ekirch found references that this modality of sleeping started to desapear in the late of the 17th century.
    - The appearance of insomnia in the literature coincides with the end of the split sleep period.
- **Modern society may place unnecessary pressure on individuals that they must have a good continous consolidated sleep every night, adding the anxiety of sleeping and perpertuating the problem.**
- The the early 1990s, the psychiatrisy Thomas A. Wehr conducted a laboratory experiment<sup>2</sup> which showed that human sleep is bifasic in short photoperiods.
  - He exposed a group of people in a shor photoperiod - they were left in the darkness for 14 hours every day - for a month.
  - By the fourth week, a distinct two-phase sleep emerged.
